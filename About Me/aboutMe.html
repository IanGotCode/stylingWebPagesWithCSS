	<p class="green">My name is Ian Gibson, I currently reside in The United States of America. I work in information technology as a computer technician, broadcast technician, audio visual techniain and backup web developer. I aspire to be a full stack web developer, God willing before this year is out. I am into music, mainly hip-hop r&b and also open to other genres of music. My second passion is basketball, I love basketball, I've played in high school, I tried out in college but however did not make it. I desire to do something better with my life, I strive for more in the sense of loving myself, respecting myself, honoring my friends and family and to learn to love everyone as they are, because it is who God has called me to be. I don't know what else to say, I'm just typing away so I will end it here.</p>
